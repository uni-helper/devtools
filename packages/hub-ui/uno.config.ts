/**
 * The shared devframe design base (see `design/uno.config.ts` and the root
 * AGENTS.md "Design system" section) plus this package's own extraction
 * globs and the dock-shell z-layers. The generated stylesheet is compiled
 * ahead of time by `scripts/build-css.ts` into `src/client/.generated/css.ts`
 * and injected into the dock custom element's **shadow root**.
 *
 * Composed on a **Wind** base rather than the shared default's Wind4:
 * `@antfu/design`'s semantic utilities compile to concrete `rgb()` + `.dark`
 * variants under Wind, which are self-contained inside a shadow tree; Wind4
 * keeps its theme/`--un-*` behind a document `:root {}` block and
 * `@property { inherits: false }`, neither of which reaches the shadow root.
 * The `safelist` guarantees the surface/text tokens ship even if a shortcut
 * class only appears via a `.dark:` variant the extractor misses.
