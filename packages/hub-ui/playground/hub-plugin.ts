/**
 * Mounts a bare, headless hub instance as Vite dev-server middleware: just
 * enough backend for `main.ts`'s `DockStandalone`/`DockEmbedded` to connect
 * to (RPC, WebSocket, `__connection.json`), plus a real mounted devframe (the
 * Git dashboard, below) so the dock bar has real content to switch between,
 * not just the client-only entries `seed.ts` registers. No `ui` slot, no
 * renderer manifest: this playground is developing hub-ui itself, not
 * exercising the wider hub protocol (`examples/custom-hub-vite` already does that).
 *
 * A hand-rolled slice of `@devframes/vite/hub` rather than that package
 * itself, because pulling it in here would make `@devframes/hub-ui` and
 * `@devframes/vite` depend on each other (`@devframes/vite` already carries
 * an optional peer dependency on `@devframes/hub-ui` for its own default UI
 * slot), a cyclic workspace dependency for no real benefit.
 *
 * `@devframes/plugin-git` is the one built-in plugin that doesn't itself
 * depend on `@devframes/vite` (every other plugin does, for its own SPA
 * dev-serve/build tooling). Mounting any of those here would reintroduce the
 * same cyclic dependency `@devframes/vite/hub` avoids, just one hop further
 * out (hub-ui → that plugin → `@devframes/vite` → hub-ui again, via its peer
 * dependency).
